  meson/MSVC: Apply /wd4828 when building gendef.exe only

  This warning only applies when compiling gendef.cc, when '/utf-8' is also being
  used, so only apply that compiler flag there.  Move the '/utf-8' to be with the
  other warning-related compiler flags for consistency's sake.
  
  Also, only build gendef.exe if it is really needed, i.e., glibmm's gmmproc is
  not able to produce headers that can export gtkmm's symbols via compiler
  directives.

  meson.build/MSVC: Disable more warnings

2022-05-23  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  meson.build/MSVC: Re-order warnings-related c[xx]flags a bit

  Don't (needlessly) repeat checking for the '/utf-8' compiler flag, and
  use the `/wd4267` compiler flag only when building a 64-bit build, since
  warning C4267 only applies for 64-bit builds.

  NMake Makefiles: Some cleanups and improvements

  Drop the ignores for warnings C4251, C4273 and C4275 from the warnings that we
  want to ignore, as the code is now free of items that trigger those warnings.
  
  Also, reorganize the compiler flags for gtkmm-demo as it is actually the /GL
  flag that triggered the internal compiler error when it is used with /EHsc on
  32-bit Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 builds.  Likewise, disable the /LTCG linker
  option when building Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 32-bit builds.

2021-04-06  Daniel Boles  <dboles.src@gmail.com>

  treeiter—Delete TreeValueProxy copy-assign/warning

  The user-provided, unimplemented operator=(TreeValueProxy const&)
  existed to prevent the class being copied, but since a long time C++
  provides a better way to do that: declaring the operator as deleted.
  
  Doing this also avoids warnings about the implicitly declared default
  copy constructor, which is deprecated due to the previously user-given
  operator=, and since the latter is now deleted the warnings are avoided.

  NMake Makefiles: Use Meson-style DLL and .lib naming if requested

  To make things more consistent and less prone to confusion, if 'USE_MESON_LIBS'
  is specified in the NMake command line, build the DLLs and .lib's that are
  named like the Meson counterparts.  Binaries built with Meson+Visual Studio
  and the ones that are built via NMake using 'USE_MESON_LIBS' are
  interchangeable, provided that they are built with the same Visual Studio
  version.

  MSVC_NMake/README: Update build info

  Note that it is possible to build with Visual Studio with Meson, on the
  condition that the -mm dependencies are built with Meson as well, since we need
  their pkg-config files.
  
  Also note that the same compiler version should be used to build gtkmm and the
  -mm dependencies, even for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.

2020-06-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Apply toolset version for Meson-built deps

  As the Meson build files for Visual Studio apply the toolset version in the
  .lib filenames by default, apply the toolset version in the Meson-built -mm
  .lib files that we link in, just as we did when we we link in the -mm .lib
  files that was built with NMake, by default.
  
  The option 'USE_COMPAT_LIBS' will also mean that we will use the former
  behavior when we link in the Meson-built -mm .lib's, just as we did when we
  link in the NMake-built -mm .lib's.

2020-06-30  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson/Visual Studio builds: Include toolset version by default

  This makes the built DLL and .lib's contain the toolset version if the build is
  carried out using Visual Studio 2015 or later, unless the
  'msvc14x-parallel-installable' option is set to be false during configuration.
  
  The reasoning behind this change is that there are subtle problems when, for
  instance, one tries to link to a Visual Studio 2015-built glibmm when building
  gtkmm and libxml++ with Visual Studio 2017 or 2019.  This is unfortunate as
  Microsoft did try hard to make interoperating between binaries built with
  Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 as easy as possible in terms of ABI and API,
  but unfortunately this hits the corner cases where this compatibility does not
  work.
  
  As the name suggests, this attempts to make Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019
  builds share a single set of underlying C DLLs easier, while avoiding breakages
  caused by such subtle differences.

  NMake Makefiles: Clean up building demo and test programs

  We can group some items together and "generate" the build rules for the test

2020-06-17  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Fix 32-bit Visual Studio 2017 builds

  We need to disable /EHsc in the compiler flags when building gtkmm-demo,
  because it turns out that the linking will fail with an internal compiler error
  like on Visual Studio 2015 32-bit builds.
  
  The x64 builds on Visual Studio 2015 and later and 32-bit builds on Visual
  Studio 2019 build and run as expected.

2020-06-17  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Distinguish between MSVC 2015, 2017 and 2019

  It was found that we cannot completely rely on the fact that Visual
  Studio 2015~2019 tried very hard to be binary compatible, as there
  are corner cases when linking against glibmm built with Visual
  Studio 2015 with builds done by Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 where
  the code will fail to link and the DLLs are therefore not
  ABI-compatible.  Note that the libsigc++ DLLs, however, are ABI
  compatible between these 3 Visual Studio versions.
  
  As a result, for the DLL and LIB names, use 'vc140' for Visual Studio
  2015 builds, 'vc141' for Visual Studio 2017 builds and 'vc142' for
  Visual Studio 2019 builds, according to the toolset versions as defined
  by Microsoft.
  
  For people that may have previously built gtkmm (and glibmm) with Visual
  Studio 2017 or 2019, which had 'vc140' in the built .lib and DLL, an NMake
  option 'USE_COMPAT_LIBS' is added to make building such binaries with
  'vc140' easier, if needed.

  Meson: Fix linking demos and tests on Visual Studio

  GTK (and therefore gtkmm) applications require a linker flag
  '-entry:mainCRTStartup' if building with 'gui_app' is set to be true (which
  means, we are using /subsystem:windows in the linker flags on Visual Studio)
  unless a WinMain() is defined in the individual application's sources.
  
  This fixes the build of such programs by adding this linker flag where it is
  needed.

  We can safely ignore warnings C4251, C4273 and C4275 as we are sure that we
  want to use __declspec(dllimport) on the libraries that we depend upon, and
  even with the C++11 versions, we are basically tied to the same CRT as Visual
  Studio 2015 or later is required to build the C++11 branches of the the -mm
  dependencies fully.
  
  We can also ignore warning C4805 since a 'gboolean' is defined to mimic a
  'bool'.

  [gdk|gtk]mmconfig.h.meson: Define [GDK|GTK]MM_API appropriately

  Like in the [gdk|gtk]mmconfig.h.in files, we want to put the definitions of
  [GDK|GTK]MM_API in there appropriately, so that we may be able to build without
  gendef.exe

2020-05-15  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  Meson: Clean-up and fix dependency search

  Since we have Meson build files for the C++ dependencies, just use the normal
  dependency search via pkg-config for all the -mm dependencies.  This also
  includes looking for atkmm, unless we request not to.
  
  We do, however, want to look for gtk+-unix-print-3.0 only if we are not
  building on Windows (at least), becuase there is no way that it will be there
  on Windows.
  
  Also clean up the parts where we decide whether to build gdkmm/gtkmm as a
  shared library directly without using gendef.exe.

2020-05-15  Kjell Ahlstedt  <kjellahlstedt@gmail.com>

  Add support for building gtkmm with Meson

  gtkmm-3.0 can be built with either Autotools or Meson.
  New files have been copied from glibmm-2.4 and atkmm-1.6 and modified.
  
  See MR !24

  NMake Makefiles: Ignore warning C4273

  We are likely using the dll-interface for our builds here, which we know pretty
  well, so we can just ignore this warning here too, as our builds here are tied
  to the CRT version

2020-05-13  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Export symbols without gendef if possible

  We check to see whether we have a new-enough gmmproc that is capable of
  generating the headers from the .hg templates with function decorations
  at places where they need to be.  If it is, we skip building gendef and
  use __declspec(dllexport) to export the needed symbols.
  
  Otherwise, we continue to use gendef.exe to export symbols, as we did
  before.

  gtk/gtkmm/*.h: Mark functions with GTKMM_API

  If gmmproc is new enough to generate the full sources from the .hg files
  with GTKMM_API applied to all applicable places, we can use this to
  export symbols without the need to use gendef.exe.
  
  The build-time check to check if gmmproc is new enough will be in an
  upcoming commit.

2020-05-13  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  gtk/src/*.hg: Mark classes and functions with GTKMM_API

  Mark all the classes and methods/functions (if applicable) with
  GTKMM_API so that we can use it to export symbols, if gmmproc is new
  enough to apply GTKMM_API to the _WRAP_ENUM, _WRAP_GERROR, _WRAP_EQUAL*
  and _CLASS_* items.
  
  The check on whether gmmproc is new enough will be in an upcoming
  commit.

2020-05-13  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  tools/m4/class_gtkobject.m4: Allow applying decorations

  This updates the _CLASS_GTKOBJECT m4 macro so that we can decorate the
  declarations of classes and wrap functions with decorations so that we
  can use them to export symbols via defining those decorations with
  compiler directives.

2020-05-13  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  gdk/gdkmm/*.h: Mark functions with GDKMM_API

  If gmmproc is new enough to generate the full sources from the .hg files
  with GDKMM_API applied to all applicable places, we can use this to
  export symbols without the need to use gendef.exe.
  
  The build-time check to check if gmmproc is new enough will be in an
  upcoming commit.

  items.

  commit.

  gtk/gtkmmconfig.h.in: Re-organize GTKMM_API definitions

  This way, we can update the public headers and use this macro to export
  symbols without using gendef if the classes and methods are marked
  adequately.

2020-05-13  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  gdk/gdkmmconfig.h.in: Add GDKMM_API

  This enables us to use this macros later in public headers so that we
  can export symbols from the DLLs using compiler directives, instead of
  gendef, if we marked classes and APIs/methods sufficiently.

  NMake Makefiles: Fix previous commit on /utf-8

  The previous commit only meant "Visual Studio 2017 or later", where it should

  NMake Makefiles: Use /utf-8 if available

  This flag is provided on Visual Studio 2015 and later, so that it will help to
  work around unicode handling issues that occur when building on East Asian
  locales, that is demonstrated by error/warning C4819.
  
  Disabling warning C4828 is meant for gendef.exe, which comes as a consequence
  of using /utf-8.

  docs/reference/images/stock: Remove .svg files

  There are about 200 unused .svg files. Remove them. Stock items are
  deprecated. They are removed in gtk4 and gtkmm4.
  
  When Meson support is added, and tarballs are created with 'ninja dist',
  all files stored in git will be included in the tarballs unless
  removed by a custom command. It's easier to remove unused files
  from the git repo.

2020-05-09  Kjell Ahlstedt  <kjellahlstedt@gmail.com>

  Fix build with X11 backend disabled

  * configure.ac:
  * gdk/gdkmmconfig.h.in: Define GDKMM_X11_BACKEND_ENABLED if X11 API
  shall be built.
  * gtk/src/plug.hg:
  * gtk/src/socket.hg: Enable in wrap_init.cc if GDKMM_X11_BACKEND_ENABLED
  is defined. (Was enabled if GDK_WINDOWING_X11 was defined.)
  
  This was partly fixed 8 years ago. See Bugzilla #678883. But it failed if
  the X11 backend was available in gtk, but X11-only code shall still not
  be built in gtkmm. (configuration with --enable-x11-backend=no)

  NMake Makefiles: Allow linking to more Meson-built items

  atkmm and cairomm recently gained Meson build files, so add their libary
  and DLL names to the NMake Makefiles so that we can easily link to them
  when we use USE_MESON_LIBS in the NMake command line.

  NMake Makefiles: Avoid an Internal Compiler Error

  On Visual Studio 2015 32-bit, the compiler crashes while building
  gtkmm3-demo with /EHsc enabled, so disable that if we are on Visual

2020-04-13  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Fix test program build rules

  We want to make sure that we really do re-link the test programs if either
  or both of gdkmm and gtkmm were rebuilt.
  
  Also, remove repeated use of /wd4275, since we are using that throughout
  the build of gtkmm.

2020-04-10  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Mention about the 'prep-git-build' target

  Let people know how it may be used to build from GIT checkouts.

  NMake Makefiles: Fix headers 'install'

  The previous update accidentily removed the parts where we copy the
  deprecated header files, so we want to restore that.
  
  We also want to streamline whether we copy the deprecated hand-written
  headers by whether we include deprecated items in the build.

2020-04-08  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Update build info

  Tell people about the build options USE_MESON_LIBS and
  GMMPROC[_PANGO|_ATK]_DIR.

2020-04-08  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Support linking to Meson-built -mm deps

  This makes it easier for people that want to build dependencies with
  Meson as far as possible, by adding an USE_MESON_LIBS NMake option.
  
  Note that by using USE_MESON_LIBS at this time of writing, libsigc++,
  glibmm and pangomm should be built by Meson, and atkmm and cairomm
  should also link to the Meson-built variants of glibmm and libsigc++ as
  well (as atkmm and cairomm do not yet have Meson build files).

2020-04-08  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Speed up builds

  Just use 'md' to create the intermediate build directories, so that we
  do not need to re-load NMake Makefile stuff that often, so this should
  make things build faster.
  
  This also enables us to clean up generate-msvc.mak as well.

2020-04-08  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Fix 'nmake tests'

  Make sure that we have all the rules for the various test programs
  that are listed by their directories in $(srcroot)/tests

  NMake Makefiles: Fix up 'nmake clean'

  Look instead for the build directories by using the dirname's in
  $(srcroot)/tests, and constructing the IntDir paths from them.

2020-04-06  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Silence some warnings

  Enable /EHsc so that we do not receive warning C4577 for constexpr
  usage.
  
  Also disable warnings C4251 and C4275 as they relate to whether we are
  using __declspec(dllimport) for the public symbols in the glibmm
  headers, when building against glibmm 2.64.0 or later.  Since we know
  what we are indeed going to use __declspec(dllimport) as we build against
  glibmm 2.64.0 or later, we can just ignore those warnings.

2020-04-06  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Add rules to generate sources

  This way, we are now able to build directly from a GIT checkout by first
  running the 'prep-git-build' target before running the NMake build
  itself.
  
  This will require PERL (with XML::Parser) and some common UNIX utilities
  such as 'cp' and 'rm' in order to run gmmproc from glibmm.  Note that
  the m4 files for atkmm and pangomm used for their code generation are
  required as well.

2020-04-06  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Add rules to generate versioned items

  This adds rules to generate [gdk|gtk]mm/[gdk|gtk]mm.rc and
  [gdk|gtk]mm/[gdk|gtk]mmconfig.h from their .in counterparts by reading
  from configure.ac.

2020-04-06  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Separate OutDir and IntDir by PDB version

  This way, we reduce the likelyhood that object files built by different
  toolset versions get mixed up with the ones built by other toolset
  versions, which can well be a source of trouble.

2020-04-05  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  NMake Makefiles: Standardize on PDB version

  Make the default prefix relate to the PDB version, not the Visual Studio
  version.  This is becuase the dependent C++-11 -mm libraries already did
  so.

  RGBA.set_hsv(): Properly interpret hue 360° as red

  (bug found and commit message by Daniel Boles; patch proposed by Kjell)
  
  We document an inclusive range of 0..360 degrees, but we divide by 60
  and switch over that, only handling 6 cases. So, hue 360° got treated as
  300° i.e. magenta, when instead it should be equivalent to 0° i.e. red.
  
  The simplest fix is this proposed by Kjell: to treat case i == 6 (360° /
  60°) the same as case i == 0, thereby making 360° red hue just like 0°.
  
  This exists only to achieve that; do not pass values outwith 0 <= h <=
  360 and expect anything but UB, as we document/assume that range only.

  MSVC_NMake/config-msvc.mak: Use $(PDBVER) in DLL names

  Since this is the C++-11 version of gtkmm which supports both Visual
  Studio 2015 and 2017, we want to name the DLL and .lib to be like
  <library>-vc140-3_0.[dll.lib] or <library>-vc140-d-3_0.[dll|lib] since
  they both link to the v140 Windows C/C++ runtime DLLs, and thus these
  DLLs and .lib's are advertised to be interoperable, as supported by
  Microsoft.
  
  Note that the master branch, which requires C++-17, is not changed
  as Visual Studio 2017 is really required to build things there.

  MenuItem: Fix typo altough => although

  Container: ForeachSlot takes Widget&, not Widget*

  Fix the example, and while here, add an introductory line for the type,
  and mirror master in putting a line <br>eak between the text and code.

  object: Add Gtk::make_managed<T>(args...) helper

  To avoid the discouraged pattern of manually writing `new` and get
  tidier syntax, follow the example of std::make_(unique|shared)() by
  adding a new helper function that both constructs and manages a widget
  in one call. The user will not need to `new` and can user fewer parens.
  
    auto button = Gtk::manage(new Gtk::Button("_Hi", true));
  
  becomes
  
    auto button = Gtk::make_managed<Gtk::Button>("_Hi", true);
  
  Switch to make_managed() in tests and demo, albeit nowhere else (yet?).

  gtk-demo/demowindow: Avoid compiler warning by g++

  Flip the if/else case so that the /* Fall through */ comment comes
  before the next case label, which suppresses a warning from
  -Wimplicit-fallthrough and looks clearer anyway.

  build: Remove Visual Studio 2013 projects

  Since the NMake Makefiles replaced the Visual Studio projects, this
  commit drops them.

2018-09-07  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  build: Add NMake Makefiles for Visual Studio builds

  This adds NMake Makefiles for Visual Studio 2013 and later, which will
  replace the Visual Studio projects.  The main motivation for this is to
  ease maintenace on the Visual Studio build files, especially as sources
  are often added or removed, making the project files out-of-date as they
  are not generated during 'dist make'.  This will share the various
  filelist.am's so that any additions or removal of sources can be
  reflected upon the Visual Studio builds immediately.
  
  Note that as some code in the demos require compiler features that is
  only available in Visual Studio 2015 or later, we only build the demos
  if Visual Studio 2015 or later is used.

2018-09-07  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  build: Remove GNU Makeisms from filelist.am's

  This is so that they can be used by the NMake Makefiles as well.

  gendef: Skip CRT symbols that are implemented inline

  As a result to the move of UCRT for Visual Studio 2015 and later, some
  of the CRT functions are no longer done in the CRT DLL, but are instead
  implemented directly in the CRT headers.  We need to filter out these
  symbols so that we can link the gtkmm DLL properly.
  
  Unfortunately we cannot just link to legacy_stdio_definitions.lib to
  resolve this, so we just have to strip these symbols out from the
  generated gtkmm.def.

2018-09-07  Chun-wei Fan  <fanchunwei@src.gnome.org>

  build: Rename MSVC_Net2013 to MSVC_NMake

  This prepares for the transition to NMake Makefiles for the Visual Studio
  build system, which aims to reduce the likelihood of it becoming outdated
  as it shares the filelist.am's with the autotools build system, instead
  of being manually updated.

  Gtk:MenuItem, Menus demo: Avoid the deprecated get_accel_group()

  * demos/gtk-demo/example_menus.cc: Don't use Gtk::Window::get_accel_group().
  * gtk/src/menuitem.ccg: accelerate(): Don't use get_accel_group(), if
  gtkmm is built without deprecated API. See issue #18

2018-08-24  Daniel Boles  <dboles@src.gnome.org>

  Gtk::Window: Move to a proper get_accel_groups()

  The existing get_accel_group() just creates a per-window AccelGroup on
  demand and returns it. That’s no use if you need groups that were added
  by other sources, e.g. by Gtk::Builder, Glade, etc.
  
  Deprecate that, in favour of a new get_accel_groups(), which wraps
  gtk_accel_groups_from_object() to return the actual set of AccelGroups.
  
  Note that gtk_accel_groups_from_object() takes a GObject, which it says
  is usually a GtkWindow. I therefore assume users will only want to get
  groups from a Window.
  
  While here:
   - Add a . to the Doxygen comment to tell it the 1st line is a summary
   - Don’t say the default group can’t be removed; I see no reason why not
   - Remove speculative comments on the old code, now explained elsewhere.
  
  Fixes #18

  Pixbufs demo: Use Gdk::FrameClock

  The corresponding demo in gtk+ uses GdkFrameClock.
  
  Also, make the pixbufs demo in gtkmm more C++'ish by minimizing the use
