Building gtkmm-3.0 with Visual Studio 2013 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2013 (MSVC 12.0) or later. Earlier versions of the compiler, including 11.0
  and earlier will not work.  The build can be carried out using the NMake Makefiles supplied in this
  directory, or via using Meson.  Meson is only supported if libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm and pangomm
  are built with Meson as well.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+
* Build libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm atkmm and pangomm from source, with the same compiler version, even if
  on Visual Studio 2015, 2017 or 2019.  If there are strange linker errors, they are likely caused by
  mixing different compiler versions.
* Use the Visual Studio command prompt that is appropriate for your build and navigate to this directory.
* Run nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release].  Also pass in PREFIX=<path> to this command line if
  GTK+, libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm and pangomm are not in $(srcroot)\..\vs[12|14|15]\$(platform).
  Pass in DISABLE_DEPRECATED to disable building deprecated gtkmm APIs into the final DLL.
  Note that vs12 stands for Visual Studio 2013, vs14 stands for Visual Studio 2015 and vs15 stands for
  Visual Studio 2017.
* Build the tests by appending 'test' to the NMake command line in the previous step.
